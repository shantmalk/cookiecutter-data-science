# Cookiecutter Data Science

_A logical, reasonably standardized but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._

**Cookiecutter Data Science (CCDS)** is a tool for setting up a data science project template that incorporates best practices. To learn more about CCDS's philosophy, visit the [project homepage](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/).

> ℹ️ Cookiecutter Data Science v2 has changed from v1. It now requires installing the new cookiecutter-data-science Python package, which extends the functionality of the [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html) templating utility. Use the provided `ccds` command-line program instead of `cookiecutter`.

## Cookiecutter Data Science Forked Requirements

Cookiecutter Data Science fork will be used to encourage standardization and organization while conducting scientific research.  This fork specifically includes functionality for environment setup, that will hopefully streamline accessing data from various sources.

This is a personalized fork to fulfill the following requirements:

- Include Jupyter notebook template
- Option to add personalized credentials, paths, and PYTHONPATH to `.env` file
- Option to add `git submodule`
- Option to specify external data storage location
- Create `.venv` on setup
- Automatically run requirements.txt
- Automatically initiate `git` repo
- Revised scaffolding based on personal preferences
- Revised `.gitignore` to ignore common image filetypes

## Installation

Cookiecutter Data Science v2 requires Python 3.8+. Since this is a cross-project utility application, we recommend installing it with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). Installation command options:

```bash
# With pipx from PyPI (recommended)
pipx install cookiecutter-data-science

# With pip from PyPI
pip install cookiecutter-data-science

# With conda from conda-forge (coming soon)
# conda install cookiecutter-data-science -c conda-forge
```

## Starting a new project

To start a new project, run:

```bash
ccds
```

### The resulting directory structure

The directory structure of your new project will look something like this (depending on the settings that you choose):

```
├── LICENSE            <- Open-source license if one is chosen
├── Makefile           <- Makefile with convenience commands like `make data` or `make train`
├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
├── data
│   ├── external       <- Data from third party sources.
│   ├── interim        <- Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   ├── processed      <- The final, canonical data sets for modeling.
│   └── raw            <- The original, immutable data dump.
│
├── docs               <- A default mkdocs project; see www.mkdocs.org for details
│
├── models             <- Trained and serialized models, model predictions, or model summaries
│
├── notebooks          <- Jupyter notebooks. Naming convention is a number (for ordering),
│                         the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g.
│                         `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`.
│
├── pyproject.toml     <- Project configuration file with package metadata for 
│                         {{ cookiecutter.module_name }} and configuration for tools like black
│
├── references         <- Data dictionaries, manuals, and all other explanatory materials.
│
├── reports            <- Generated analysis as HTML, PDF, LaTeX, etc.
│   └── figures        <- Generated graphics and figures to be used in reporting
│
├── requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.
│                         generated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
│
├── setup.cfg          <- Configuration file for flake8
│
└── {{ cookiecutter.module_name }}   <- Source code for use in this project.
```

## Using v1

If you want to use the old v1 project template, you need to have either the cookiecutter-data-science package or cookiecutter package installed. Then, use either command-line program with the `-c v1` option:

```bash
ccds https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science -c v1
# or equivalently
cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendataorg/cookiecutter-data-science -c v1
```
